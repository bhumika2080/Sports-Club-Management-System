        At Sports Club Management, we help Players achieve their goals.
    </p><br>
    Sports Club Management System is a website to manage games(sports) played.
    This system is developed to keep track of different sporting events with multiple games played among multiple teams.
    Here, players, coach and parents alike can get all the information of various games, events and the venue.
    Members can get registered from anywhere and at any time. By using this system and making various procedures
    automated,
    the members can save a lot of time and
    effort.
    <p><br>
        In Nepal, there is not much facilities for players: professional or not. With this system we hope to make things
        easier
        for our players even if its just a little bit.
    </p><br><br>
    Sports Club Management System is a Project developed by BCA students Bhumika Baruwal and
    Rani Kumari Gupta. If there is anything you would like<br> help with or have questions
    please don't hesitate to contact us.
